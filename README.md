### Hi 👋, I'm Ege!

I'm an undergraduate researcher at Columbia Engineering. My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning, as well as their interactions with human perception.

- 🔭 I’m currently working with Visual Language Models (e.g. CLIP) to create a task-agnostic mapping between vision and natural language. 
- 📫 How to reach me: ege.ozguroglu@columbia.edu
- 🌊 Fun fact: _Ege_ is the Turkish name of the _Aegean Sea_, an arm of the Mediterrenean between Turkey and Greece.
