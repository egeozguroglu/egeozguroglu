### Hi 👋, I'm Ege!

I'm an undergraduate researcher and teaching assistant at Columbia Engineering. 

- 🔭 My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision & machine learning, as well as their interactions with human perception.
- 🌊 Fun fact: _Ege_ is the Turkish name of the _Aegean Sea_, an arm of the Mediterrenean between Turkey and Greece.
