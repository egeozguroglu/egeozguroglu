### Hi ğŸ‘‹, I'm Ege!

I'm a Teaching Assistant and researcher, co-advised by Prof. Shuran Song and Carl Vondrick, at Columbia Engineering. 

- ğŸ”­ My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision & machine learning, as well as their interactions with human perception.
- ğŸŒŠ Fun fact: _Ege_ is the Turkish name of the _Aegean Sea_, an arm of the Mediterrenean between Turkey and Greece.
