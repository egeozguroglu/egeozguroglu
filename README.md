### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a Research Associate (Staff Associate I) at Columbia University, immensely fortunate to be advised by [Carl Vondrick](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~vondrick/). Currently, I'm working on projects in collaboration with [Shuran Song](https://shurans.github.io/) of Stanford University, [Pavel Tokmakov](https://pvtokmakov.github.io/home/) and [Achal Dave](https://www.achaldave.com/) of Toyota Research Institute.

My research interests lie primarily in learning-based Computer Vision. More specifically, I enjoy building models that emulate the abilities toddlers, new to their visual environment, naturally acquire. I am hence also interested in leveraging multi-modal signals complementary to vision. I believe that such models can efficiently generalize, spatially reason, and creatively interact.

Previously, I graduated from Columbia Engineering with a B.S. in Computer Science, where I was introduced to Computer Vision and Deep Learning research by Shuran Song and Carl Vondrick.
